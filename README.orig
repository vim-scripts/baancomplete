Baan omni completion for vim

Features:
    Function argument completion
    completeopt+=preview support, displaying DllUsage/EndDllUsage comments

Installation:

Copy baancomplete.vim into your ~/.vim/autoload/ or $VIMRUNTIME/autoload directory.
Make sure to enable ftplugins via 'filetype plugin on'.
Filetype detection will then set up the omni-completion appropriately.
If it doesn't you will need to add "set omnifunc=baancomplete#Complete" in your .vimrc

Generating the api-documentation:

baancomplete needs an API file for the completion to work.
This API file isn't shipped. 
Instead it contains a script (gen_api.py) with which you may generate an API file yourself.

You'll need to export the program scripts documents from within BAAN using the ttstpbaandoc session.
See dlls.txt for documentations you'll want to export.

After that you can run gen_api.py to generate your api file.
Copy that file to $HOME/.vim/plugin/baancomplete_api.sqlite and you're done.

Requirements:

Vim7 compiled with +python support.

Python 2.7 with BeautifulSoup for gen_api.py
